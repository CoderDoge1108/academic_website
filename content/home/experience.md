  #       Institute fot Software Integrated Systems
        
  #       * Built a contrastive learning method to facilitates representation learning of binary code visualized by distribution analysis, and improves the performance on all three downstream tasks of software engineering and security by 5.45% on average compared to state-of-the-art large-scale language representation models (under reivew by [ISSTA](https://conf.researchr.org/home/issta-2023)).
  #       * Designed an AST-based representation for source code that leverages program structure and semantics to improve state-of-the-art code clone detection. Our experimental results show that the model improves state-of-the-art neural clone detection approaches by up to 6.6% in F-1 score (accepted by [ICSE](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2023) workshop).
